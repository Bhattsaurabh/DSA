Question: Number of substrings containing all three characters.

Given a string s consisting only of characters a, b and c.

Return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters a, b and c.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabc"
Output: 10
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "abc", "abca", "abcab", "abcabc", "bca", "bcab", "bcabc", "cab", "cabc" and "abc" (again). 
Example 2:

Input: s = "aaacb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "aaacb", "aacb" and "acb". 
Example 3:

Input: s = "abc"
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

3 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^4
s only consists of a, b or c characters.


Code:

// sliding window

 int numberOfSubstrings(string s) {

        int n = s.size();

        unordered_map<char, int>um;

        int i=0,j=0;
        int ans=0;


        while(j<n)
        {
            um[s[j]]++;

            while(i<n && um.size() == 3)
            {
                ans += n-j;

                um[s[i]]--;
                if(um[s[i]] == 0)
                   um.erase(s[i]);

                i++;
            }

            j++;

        }

        return ans;
        
    }
