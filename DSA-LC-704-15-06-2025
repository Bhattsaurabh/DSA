Question: Max difference you can get from changing an integer.


You are given an integer num. You will apply the following steps to num two separate times:

Pick a digit x (0 <= x <= 9).
Pick another digit y (0 <= y <= 9). Note y can be equal to x.
Replace all the occurrences of x in the decimal representation of num by y.
Let a and b be the two results from applying the operation to num independently.

Return the max difference between a and b.

Note that neither a nor b may have any leading zeros, and must not be 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: num = 555
Output: 888
Explanation: The first time pick x = 5 and y = 9 and store the new integer in a.
The second time pick x = 5 and y = 1 and store the new integer in b.
We have now a = 999 and b = 111 and max difference = 888
Example 2:

Input: num = 9
Output: 8
Explanation: The first time pick x = 9 and y = 9 and store the new integer in a.
The second time pick x = 9 and y = 1 and store the new integer in b.
We have now a = 9 and b = 1 and max difference = 8
 

Constraints:

1 <= num <= 10^8


code:

int maxDiff(int num) {

        string s1 = to_string(num);;
        string s2 = s1;

        char maxChar = '$';
        
        for(int i=0; i<s1.size(); i++)
        {   
            if( s1[i] != '9' && maxChar == '$' )
            {
                maxChar = s1[i];
                s1[i] = '9';
            }

            if(s1[i] == maxChar)
            {
                s1[i] = '9';
            }
        }
        

        for(int i=0; i<s2.size(); i++)
            {   
                char ch = s2[i];
                if( i==0 && s2[i] != '1' )
                {
                  replace(s2.begin(), s2.end(), ch, '1');
                  break;
                }
                else if(s2[i] != '0' && s2[i] != s2[0])
                {
                    replace(s2.begin(), s2.end(), ch, '0');
                    break;
                }
               
               
            }

        int maxi = stoi(s1);
        int mini = stoi(s2);

        return   maxi - mini;

    }
