Question: Longest Well-Performing Interval.


We are given hours, a list of the number of hours worked per day for a given employee.

A day is considered to be a tiring day if and only if the number of hours worked is (strictly) greater than 8.

A well-performing interval is an interval of days for which the number of tiring days is strictly larger than the number of non-tiring days.

Return the length of the longest well-performing interval.

 

Example 1:

Input: hours = [9,9,6,0,6,6,9]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest well-performing interval is [9,9,6].
Example 2:

Input: hours = [6,6,6]
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

1 <= hours.length <= 104
0 <= hours[i] <= 16

Code:

 int longestWPI(vector<int>& hours) {

        int n = hours.size();
        int ans = 0;
        unordered_map<int,int>um;
        int currSum=0;
        
        for(int i=0 ;i<n;i++)
        {
           if(hours[i] > 8)
            currSum += 1;
           else
            currSum += -1;

            if(currSum > 0)
            {
                ans = i+1;
            }
            else{

                if(um.find(currSum) == um.end())
                {
                    um[currSum] = i;
                }

                if(um.find(currSum-1) != um.end())
                {
                    ans = max(ans, (i - um[currSum - 1]) );
                }
            }
        }

        return ans;
        
    }
