Question: Lexicographically smallest equivalent string.

You are given two strings of the same length s1 and s2 and a string baseStr.

We say s1[i] and s2[i] are equivalent characters.

For example, if s1 = "abc" and s2 = "cde", then we have 'a' == 'c', 'b' == 'd', and 'c' == 'e'.
Equivalent characters follow the usual rules of any equivalence relation:

Reflexivity: 'a' == 'a'.
Symmetry: 'a' == 'b' implies 'b' == 'a'.
Transitivity: 'a' == 'b' and 'b' == 'c' implies 'a' == 'c'.
For example, given the equivalency information from s1 = "abc" and s2 = "cde", "acd" and "aab" are equivalent strings of baseStr = "eed", and "aab" is the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of baseStr.

Return the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of baseStr by using the equivalency information from s1 and s2.

 

Example 1:

Input: s1 = "parker", s2 = "morris", baseStr = "parser"
Output: "makkek"
Explanation: Based on the equivalency information in s1 and s2, we can group their characters as [m,p], [a,o], [k,r,s], [e,i].
The characters in each group are equivalent and sorted in lexicographical order.
So the answer is "makkek".
Example 2:

Input: s1 = "hello", s2 = "world", baseStr = "hold"
Output: "hdld"
Explanation: Based on the equivalency information in s1 and s2, we can group their characters as [h,w], [d,e,o], [l,r].
So only the second letter 'o' in baseStr is changed to 'd', the answer is "hdld".
Example 3:

Input: s1 = "leetcode", s2 = "programs", baseStr = "sourcecode"
Output: "aauaaaaada"
Explanation: We group the equivalent characters in s1 and s2 as [a,o,e,r,s,c], [l,p], [g,t] and [d,m], thus all letters in baseStr except 'u' and 'd' are transformed to 'a', the answer is "aauaaaaada".
 

Constraints:

1 <= s1.length, s2.length, baseStr <= 1000
s1.length == s2.length
s1, s2, and baseStr consist of lowercase English letters.


Code:


    char dfs(char ch,  unordered_map<char, set<int>>&um, vector<int> &vis)
    {
        vis[ch - 'a'] = 1;
        char ans = ch;

        for(auto x: um[ch])
        {
            if(vis[x - 'a'] == 0) 
            {
                ans = min(ans, dfs(x, um, vis));
            }
           
        }
      
        return ans;

    }


    string smallestEquivalentString(string s1, string s2, string baseStr) {

        unordered_map<char, set<int>>um;
        int n = s1.size();
        string ans="";

        for(int i=0 ;i<n ;i++)
        {
            um[s1[i]].insert(s2[i]);
            um[s2[i]].insert(s1[i]);
        }

        unordered_map<char, char>um1;
        

        for(int i=0 ;i<baseStr.size(); i++)
        {
            if(um.find(baseStr[i]) == um.end())
            {
                ans += baseStr[i];
            }
            else{
                vector<int>vis(26, 0);
                char ch = dfs(baseStr[i], um, vis);
                ans += ch;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
